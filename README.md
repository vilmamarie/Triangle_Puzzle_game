Note: You can of course also run this with an IDE such as IntelliJ which might be a better option if you want to inspect the code more closely or run the tests separately.

## Testing
Tests are automatically run every time the application is launched. If you would like to run them separately or inspect them more closely I recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ.
